# Tabbed Application Starter with Flutter Navigator 2

This sample app is a good template to start your application
development with `nav2_with_tabs` package. You get declarative UI and Navigator 2.0 support abstracted away and out-of-the-box, together with a simple pattern of how to create screen, their routes, and how to add them to tabs.

Please see main package [README.md](../README.md) for details.
