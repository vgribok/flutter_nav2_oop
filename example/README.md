# Tabbed Application Starter with Flutter Declarative Navigation

This sample app demonstrates the `flutter_nav2_oop` package with near-zero boilerplate code. It showcases:

- **Riverpod v3** with code generation (`@riverpod` annotations)
- **Riverpod Restorable v3** for ephemeral state restoration
- **Declarative navigation** with tab-based routing
- **Provider-based state management** with clean separation of concerns

The example includes multiple tabs (Books, Counter, Settings, User, Stories) demonstrating various navigation patterns, async data loading, and state restoration.

Please see main package [README.md](../README.md) for details.
