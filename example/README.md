# Tabbed Application Starter with Flutter Navigation 2

This sample app is a good template to start your application development with `flutter_nav2_oop` package, resulting in near zero boilerplate code. You get the declarative UI and Navigator 2.0 support abstracted away and out-of-the-box, together with a simple pattern of how to create screens, their routes, and how to add them to tabs.

Please see main package [README.md](../README.md) for details.
